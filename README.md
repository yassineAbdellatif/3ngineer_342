To run the code, open 2 terminals:
/backend
/frontend

Write npm start on both terminals.
On a web browser, open:
(http://localhost:3000)
(http://localhost:5000/api/connections)
Click on search in the front end UI. This will display all connections.
A small delay may happend between the click and the display to find all possible connections.
